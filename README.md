# javascript Tic tac toe

> In this project, we built a game called TIC TAC TOE. 
Where Users can:

- Introduce the name of the players.
- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie
